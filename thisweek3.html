                <p>There are so many places you could go to buy coffee. We've gone to extraordinary efforts to ensure 
                that <a href="index3.html">SCAAL</a> is your best choice. The quality begins at harvest.</p>
                <p><a href="index3.html">SCAAL</a> relies on selective picking, a labor-intensive process that involves making 
                several passes among the trees for those cherries that are perfectly ripe. Then we select top grade SHB, which 
                stands for strictly hard bean or strictly high grown.</p>
                <p>Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet above sea level for optimum flavor. Within hours of 
                shipping our coffee to you, the beans are roasted on-site in small batches by a Certified Roastmaster and 
                vacuum-packed to retain its fresh taste and rich aroma.</p>
